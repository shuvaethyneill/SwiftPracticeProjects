# SwiftPracticeProjects
### A collection of projects I have made while learning Swift!

## Featured projects:

### 1. Tap Counter (Version 1)
The first project I built while learning the fundamentals of Swift. The counter label will increment as the user clicks the Tap button. The counter will be reset back to 0 if the Reset button is clicked.
